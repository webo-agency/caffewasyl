== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is GDPR? =

Most companies who do any business in the EU are aware of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect on May 25, 2018. 

Organizations found in non-compliance will face heavy fines: â‚¬20 million or 4 percent of global revenue/turnover per infraction. This could mean millions, or even billions of dollars in fines for large companies.

The GDPR applies to any business, whether or not it is based in the EU, that processes the personal data of EU citizens.

= What is GDPR Consent and CMP?

Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by electronic means, or an oral statement. This could include ticking a box when visiting an internet website, choosing technical settings for information society services or another statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subject's acceptance of the proposed processing of his or her personal data. 

CMP is the technical infrastructure a business uses to collect and store what data customers have consented to be used and for what.
